# Global-Electronic-Retail

Background

Equipment, such as computers and smartphones, is widely available today, and the global
consumer electronics market generated an impressive $950 billion in revenue in 2024. What
better way than to utilize your BI skills on a dataset related to this vast industry? As a BI
analyst for GlobalElec, a leading globallectronics retailer, you will help analyze and visualize
the company's sales data, covering customers, products, sales, stores, and international
exchange rates. Your task is to uncover trends like the dominance of telephony, the rise of
online sales, and regional market leaders while crafting impactful dashboards in a BI tool of
your choice.

Your challenge

Using any BI tool you have access to, create interactive visuals and a dashboard to summarize
your research. Things to consider:

· Which countries or regions contribute the most to overall revenue?

. Which product categories and regions yield the highest profit margins?

· Are there patterns or changes in delivery times across different regions or product
categories?

. What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located?

. Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume or revenue?

. How long is the average delivery time in days? Has that changed over time?

· Is there a difference in average order value (AOV) for online vs. in-store sales?
